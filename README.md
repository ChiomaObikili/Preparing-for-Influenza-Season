<h1>Preparing for Influenza Season Project</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The united States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu and end up in the hospitals
<h2>Goal</h2>
To assist a medical staffing agency in optimizing workforce allocation by identifying flu season trends, high-risk age groups, and high-demand states to better prepare clinics and hospitals for seasonal surges.
<h2>Context & Duration</h2>
This project was completed over 2 weeks as part of a data analytics capstone. It used historical flu data in the U.S. spanning from 2009 to 2017.
<h2>My Role</h2>
Data Analyst – I led the entire analysis, including data cleaning, time series forecasting and building Tableau dashboards.
<h2>Data Source</h2>
U.S. Census Bureau (Population data by geography, time, age, and gender)
CDC Influenza deaths by geography
<h2>Tools Used</h2>
Excel (Data cleaning, early analysis)
Tableau (Data visualization, dashboard development)
<h2>Steps Taken</h2>
I cleaned and merged datasets from CDC and U.S. Census.
Performed time series analysis to identify seasonal flu patterns.
Segmented data by state and age groups (under 65 and over 65).
Built an interactive Tableau dashboard highlighting flu mortality by region and demographic.
<h2>Key Challenges and Solution</h2>
The initial age data was broad and uninformative so I re-categorized into <65 and 65+ groups to surface meaningful trends.
Displaying complex temporal patterns across 50 states was a challenge so I used heatmaps and line charts to simplify regional comparisons.
<h2>Analysis and Result</h2>
In my analysis, I considered all demographic groups susceptible to influenza, with a particular focus on age. The population was divided into two groups as seen in the Pie chart: those under 65 and those aged 65 and older. The data showed that individuals over 65 were the most at risk. Also, as shown in the Histogram California, New York, and Texas consistently emerged as the states with the highest vulnerability for this age group for the year 2009 - 2017.

<h2>Trends and Geographical Analysis</h2>
California reported the highest number of deaths in 2013, with 5,085 fatalities among seniors. New York followed with 4,298 deaths in 2015. On the other end of the spectrum, Wyoming reported the lowest number of deaths for this group—132 in 2014.

<h2>Insights</h2>
This project aimed to estimate the demand for additional medical staff during the flu season by analyzing influenza-related mortality trends across states and demographic groups. By leveraging CDC guidelines and historical data, I was able to identify key regions—particularly California, New York, Texas, and Florida—where the need for staff reinforcement is expected to be the highest.
The analysis highlighted a strong correlation between influenza-related deaths and the 65+ age group, especially in states with large elderly populations. The seasonality of the flu—despite regional variations—confirmed that December through March remains the critical period for healthcare planning.

<h2>Key Success</h2>
included identifying high-risk regions, confirming demographic vulnerabilities, and developing actionable recommendations for staffing strategies.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
Challenges involved dealing with incomplete or inconsistent historical data across some states.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
Emphasis was layed on the importance of timely data updates and targeted resource planning, especially for vulnerable populations during peak flu months.
This analysis provides a data-driven foundation for more responsive and efficient healthcare staffing during influenza season, helping to reduce strain on medical systems and improve patient outcomes.

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
Continuously update the dashboard with real-time flu case data.
Adjust staffing strategies dynamically based on resource availability and evolving case trends.
Maintain ongoing data analysis throughout the flu season to support agile and informed decision-making.
